## Purpose
Purpose of this assignment is to assess the thinking process and the approach of the developer to develop a solution.

## Challenge
Create an Internal Dashboard for analyzing the customer’s transactions.
The application should be created using VueJS. Feel free to use any [boilerplate](https://vue-community.org/guide/ecosystem/boilerplates.html). It will reduce lots of effort in setting-up the project.
Use GitHub for submission and try to do as many commits and documentation as possible, which will help us in understanding your approach and thinking process.

- Name should be clickable which shows all details of the users.
- Firm should be clickable in user list views which lists down firm details.
